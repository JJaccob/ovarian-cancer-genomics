# Ovarian Cancer Mutationâ€“Clinical Association Analysis

This project explores associations between somatic gene mutations and clinical outcomes in an ovarian cancer patient cohort. The analysis includes statistical testing and unsupervised clustering.

## Project Summary

- 50 genes (binary: mutated = 1, wild-type = 0)
- 4 clinical outcomes (all binary: 0 = no, 1 = yes):
  - `survival_status` â€“ patient survival
  - `chemo_response` â€“ response to chemotherapy
  - `surgery_type` â€“ primary vs. interval surgery
  - `cytoreduction_outcome` â€“ outcome of cytoreductive surgery

> **Note**: The original clinical-genomic dataset is not included due to data-sharing restrictions.

## Methods

- Data cleaning: removed genes with no mutations; converted clinical variables to binary
- Statistical analysis:
  - Univariate testing via Fisher's exact test
  - Multivariate logistic regression including clinical covariates
- Clustering & visualization:
  - Mutation heatmap with hierarchical clustering using the ComplexHeatmap package
  - Clinical outcomes annotated per patient

## Results

- No statistically significant gene-outcome associations after FDR correction
- Exploratory heatmaps showed visual mutation patterns that may relate to outcomes
- Genes such as **ERBB4**, **TP53**, **FLT3**, and **CSF1R** showed interesting clustering with clinical labels

These results are consistent with internal findings by collaborators and may support further hypothesis-driven studies.
